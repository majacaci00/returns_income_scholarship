### Predicting returns on income from college education and experience - the case of Ecuador’s national scholarship’s program
In this analysis I used the [mincer earnings function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincer_earnings_function) and find that marital status, gender, student's province of residence and country where student pursued his/her postgraduate studies are complementary features to explain the return of income/investement. 

I used this analysis to explain regularization methods to my students at the Machine Learning and Econometrics class at the University of San Francisco

The data for this project was collected (or scrapped)  from:

1. Senplades (Base retornado estudio) - Ecuador
